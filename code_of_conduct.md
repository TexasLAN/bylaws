**Article VIII: Hearing Policies and Procedures**

**Section 1.** Charges against the Accused

- Any person may report a violation of policies by lodging a report with a Member of Standards Board or the VP of Standards.
- When the action complained of is also a violation of University rules and regulations, the charge shall be simultaneously reported to the University&#39;s dean of students.
- When the action complained of is also a violation of criminal statutes, the facts shall be simultaneously reported to area and/or campus law enforcement authorities.
- Any charge or allegation should be submitted as soon as possible after the conduct or event takes place. If a person believes that the conduct is about to take place, a report should be submitted before the alleged conduct occurs.
- If the alleged conduct violates the Fraternity&#39;s Code of Conduct and Member Disciplinary Policy, the Standards Board along with the VP of Standards shall determine if the matter is to be treated by the Fraternity as a &quot;formal&quot; or &quot;informal&quot; charge.
- Examples of formal charges include, but are not limited to:
  - Sexual harassment
  - Assault of any nature
  - Destruction of property
  - Repeated problematic behavior
- Examples of informal charges include, but are not limited to:
  - Undesired behavior while intoxicated
  - First warnings
  - Rude behavior in online communication
- Generally, many alleged violations may be managed as an informal charge or complaint. An informal hearing may be less procedurally rigid than a formal charge, but not necessarily more lenient when applying a sanction(s). The accused Member shall be notified in writing of the informal charge(s) before discussing the matter with the Standards Board and VP of Standards. If the Standards Board and VP of Standards determines the Member Code of Conduct and Member Disciplinary Policy or other Fraternity rules or procedures have been violated, sanctions may be imposed as set forth in this policy.

**Section 2.** Integrity of the Standards Board

- In the event that a member of the Standards Board or the VP of Standards finds themselves unable to be impartial during the hearing due to personal relationships with the accused or complainant parties or otherwise, they shall do the following:
  - recuse themselves from the investigation and hearing proceedings.
  - recommend an impartial replacement from the Active membership in order to maintain the five Member judicial body.
- Recommended replacements must pass a unanimous vote of the remaining Standards Board members on the merit of their impartiality to both the accused and complainant parties. If the replacement vote does not pass, the member must continue to recommend replacements until one passes a unanimous vote.
- In the special event that the VP of Standards recuses themselves from the investigation and hearing proceedings, they must select a new acting VP of Standards from the remaining elected Standards Board members to preside over the hearing in addition to recommending their impartial replacement. If no elected Standards Board members remain, then the VP of Standards shall select an acting VP of Standards from the approved Standards Board replacements.

**Section 3.** Investigations

- The VP of Standards has the sole discretion to initiate a formal or informal investigation to determine if the charges have merit and/or if they can be disposed of administratively by mutual consent of the parties involved.
- Where a formal investigation is initiated, the Standards Board and VP of Standards shall assemble a fact-finding team that will conduct an investigation of the allegations. The fact-finding team shall be formed as soon as practicable and shall take whatever steps it deems appropriate to investigate the allegations.
- Each fact-finding team appointed by the Standards Board and VP of Standards shall include, where possible, a member of the Standards Board and whatever other Members are deemed appropriate.
- Any member of the Standards Board or VP of Standards who participates in the fact-finding team shall refrain from interactions with the accused and complainant parties outside of official Standards procedures for the duration of the investigation and, if deemed necessary, subsequent hearing in order to preserve impartiality.
- The fact-finding team may utilize whatever reasonable investigative methods are at their disposal to investigate whether an offense has been committed. These methods include, but are not limited to:
  - In-person or telephone interviews of witnesses or the accused
  - Written Statements
  - Requests for written information
  - On-site visits
  - Fact-finding conferences
- The fact-finding team must present its findings within ten (10) days of the conclusion of its investigation.

- The Accused shall have the right of timely notice of hearing, as hereinafter provided.
- The Accused has the right to be heard during the time disciplinary action is being considered.
- The Accused shall have the right to see the anonymous written charges prior to any hearing.
- The Accused shall have the right to select his own counsel from the membership of the Fraternity, but it is emphasized that the disciplinary hearing procedures are those of Texas Lambda Alpha Nu and are not the procedures that would be utilized in a court of law.
- Counsel or the Member may be asked to leave the hearing at any time by the presiding officers if, in the sole judgment of the presiding officers, counsel or the Member is disrupting the hearing.

**Section 5.** Hearings

- If the Standards Board and VP of Standards elect to treat the matter as a formal complaint, then all charges shall be presented to the accused Member in written form. A time shall be set for a hearing, no more than 15 business days after the Member has been notified. Maximum time limits for scheduling of hearings may be extended at the discretion of the Standards Board and VP of Standards.
- At the discretion of the Standards Board and VP of Standards, instead of a face-to-face hearing, participants in a hearing may be allowed to participate telephonically or submit written information.
- The complainant may choose to remain anonymous to the accused and the Standards Board and VP of Standards shall respect the complainant&#39;s wish.

  - Admission of any person to the hearing shall be at the discretion of the presiding officer.
  - The presiding officer shall expel from the hearing any person who, in his opinion, does not maintain proper decorum.

  - In hearings involving more than one accused member, the presiding officer, in his discretion, may permit the hearings concerning each Member to be conducted separately.
  - The complainant and the accused have the right to be assisted by any adviser they choose, at their own expense. The complainant and/or the accused are responsible for presenting his or her own case and, therefore, advisers are not permitted to speak or to participate directly in any hearing before the Standards Board and VP of Standards unless expressly asked to do so by the presiding officer. The complainant and the accused may present their case on separate dates in order to ensure anonymity of the complainant.
  - The complainant, the accused, and the representative of the fact-finding team shall each have the right to make an open argument before the evidence is presented and a closing argument after all the evidence has been presented. The complainant and the accused may present their arguments on separate dates to ensure the anonymity of the complainant.
  - The complainant, the accused, and the representative of the fact-finding team shall have the privilege of presenting witnesses, subject to the right of cross-examination by the Standards Board and VP of Standards. The complainant and the accused may present  their witnesses on separate dates to ensure the anonymity of the complainant.
  - The Standards Board may accept pertinent records, exhibits and written statements as evidence for consideration at the discretion of the presiding officer.
  - The presiding officer shall remind those in attendance that the proceedings are not a formal legal hearing and verdicts rendered are solely based on their merits with regards to the Member Disciplinary Policy.
  - If there is material evidence that cannot be secured from the testimony of members, non-member testimony may be received at the hearing in the discretion of the presiding officer. Non-members may be present at the hearing only while testifying.
  - All procedural questions are subject to the final decision of the presiding officer.
  - After all the evidence has been presented, the Standards Board shall determine (by majority vote) whether the Member has violated each section of the Member Code of Conduct or Member Disciplinary Policy that the Member is charged with violating.
  - The vote shall be taken separately on each offense and separately as to each accused Member.
  - The Standards Board&#39;s determination shall be made on the basis of whether it is more likely than not that the accused Member committed an offense.
  - In the event a Member fails to obey the summons of the Standards Board and VP of Standards, he or she may be disciplined. If the absentee Member has an excuse that is determined by the VP of Standards to be valid, then the Member may not be found to have violated the Code of Conduct or the Member Disciplinary Policy solely because the Member failed to appear before the Standards Board and VP of Standards. In all cases, the evidence in support of the charges shall be presented.
  - Within five (5) business days following the formal hearing, the Standards Board shall advise in writing its determination and the recommended sanction(s).
  - Within ten (10) business days following his receipt of the determination of the Standards Board, the VP of Standards must notify the accused and the Board of Officers of the sanctions imposed.
  - The notice of sanctions imposed shall be in writing and sent by certified e-mail, acknowledgement of receiving the letter is requested.
- If the Standards Board and VP of Standards decide that expulsion of a member is appropriate, they may only do so by unanimous vote, the Standards Board and VP of Standards participating. If the vote fails then the Standards Board and VP of Standards shall continue discuss the issue until a unanimous vote is reached or the decision is overturned.
  - In all other cases where expulsion is not appropriate, sanctions may be imposed with a simple majority of the Standards Board and VP of Standards.
- The Standards Board and the VP of Standards shall choose a Member to take notes during the hearing. The notes will be private to the Standards Board and the VP of Standards and used in order to reach a verdict.
