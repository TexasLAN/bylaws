NOTES ON FORMATTING:
For quality of diffs, please use one line per logical . terminated sentence.
This means that diffs are on a sentence by sentence basis and thus easier to read rather than being paragraph by paragraph which can hide exact textual changes.

**Board Order I. Purchase Proposal**

In the event that there needs to be a purchase that is not in the budget and that is also $50 or more, it must go through the proposal process as described below, otherwise the Treasurer has primary responsibility for those purchases.

1. An active member (sponsor) and co-sponsor make a copy of the [Purchase Proposal Form](./purchase_proposal_form.md) and fills out the appropriate sections (down to **Follow up date**).
2. The sponsor presents the completed proposal form to Treasurer for approval.
    1. If the proposal is rejected, the Treasurer will inform the sponsor of adjustments to be made. The proposal can be resubmitted to the Treasurer once corrected.
    2. If the proposal is approved, the process will continue as described below.
3. The Treasurer will present the purchase proposal to the Board at an officer meeting.
    1. The Board can veto the purchase proposal by a ⅔’rds vote. If vetoed, the proposal must be recreated and must go through the entire purchase proposal process again.
    2. In the event of the need for an immediate purchase, the Board may vote unanimously to immediately approve the proposal with no presentation at a general meeting. 
       Such approvals are frowned upon and should be immediately disclosed and justified to the general membership through email and in the next general meeting.
    3. If the proposal is not vetoed, the process will continue as described below.
4. The Treasurer will briefly present the purchase proposal at a general meeting.
    1. The general membership may initiate the veto process by support of three active members.

       If vetoed, the proposal must be recreated and must go through the entire purchase proposal process again.
5. The purchase proposal is executed as described in the proposal form.
6. The Treasurer will follow up with the proposal sponsor to ensure it is properly and fully executed.
7. If the purchase is not properly executed as described in the purchase proposal, the Treasurer will take steps to correct the situation (including, but not limited to, cancellation of the purchase proposal).
