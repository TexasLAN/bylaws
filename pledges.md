# ΛΑΝ Pledge Process

This document exists to serve as a record and reference of the ΛΑΝ pledge selection and induction process for existing and prospective members.
 
## First Round
 
The semesterly rush process has traditionally opened with a week of open events, consisting of two or three information session presentations, and at least one coffee or pizza night.
Exact details vary by semester.

These events are open to the public, and are advertised for example on the UTCS Facebook group.
No official attendance is taken at any of these events, and the goal of these events is to inform potential Candidates of the rush process mechanics.
However potential Candidates are heavily encouraged to create and populate profiles on Omega.
Actives are able to give feedback on Candidates via Omega at all times.

This week of informational events concludes with an application due on Omega, usually that Sunday.
After "first round" Candidate applications are closed, the Board of Officers meets to review applications.
